          <h3>Detecting Sea Lions In Aerial Images</h3>
          <p>This project uses pytorch to perform object detection and classification. The data consist of aerial images of sea lions 
            along the coast of Alaska. In wildlife management, aerial surveys are often used to estimate the size of animal populations 
            that occupy large spatial ranges. Aerial photographic surveys can capture many animals at a time over vast habitats; but it 
            can be time-consuming and difficult for human analysts to identify and count all these animals. Computer vision methods show 
            great promise in improving the speed and accuracy of identifying and classifying animals in aerial imagery.</p>

          <h3>Simulating Epidemic Dynamics Using Network Diffusion Models</h3>
          <p>This project analyses the impact of contact networks and intervention strategies on the dynamics of a simulated epidemic using
             the Python libraries NetworkX and NDlib. NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the 
             structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. NDlib is a Python package for simulating diffusion processes on 
             complex networks. </p>

          <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis Of World C02 Emissions</h3>
          <p>This project consists of a collection of jupyter notebooks that demonstrate common techniques used in 
             exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is a crucial task for researchers and data scientists to 
             gain a deeper understanding of their data. By visually and statistically examining data, EDA helps uncover patterns, identify 
             outliers, detect data quality issues, and reveal hidden relationships between variables. It aids in formulating hypotheses, 
             selecting appropriate modeling techniques, and making informed decisions during subsequent analysis.</p>

          <h3>Tracking The Spread Of Lyme Disease</h3>
          <p>This project uses maps to visualize changes in Lyme disease occurrence over time. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection 
            caused by the spirochete bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, typically transmitted to humans through the bite of infected 
            black-legged ticks. It can lead to various symptoms, including fever, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint aches, and swollen 
            lymph nodes. If left untreated, it can progress to more severe complications affecting the heart, nervous system, and joints. 
            Knowing where the disease occurs can help people take preventative measures and seek treatment when appropriate.</p>

          <h3>Time Series Prediction Using Electricity Demand Data</h3>
          <p>This project demonstrates the use of Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) 
            models for short-term electricity demand prediction. ARMA and ARIMA are popular methods for analyzing and predicting future 
            values based on historical data. Prediction quality is evaluated using RMSE.</p>

          <h3>Predicting the Extent of Harmful Algal Blooms Using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>This was a team project (developed with Charles H and Shyam V) completed during my University of Michigan Master of Applied 
            Data Science program. We used a form of unsupervised semantic segmentation to identify clusters of related pixels in 
            satellite images of lakes. The aim was to identify the presence and estimated extent of harmful algal blooms.</p>

          <h3>Re-Evaluation Of The Thiamine Dose-Response Relationship For Larval Lake Trout (Salvelinus namycush) Using An Individual Based 
            Model</h3>
          <p>This project used an individual based model to better understand sources of mortality for larval lake trout. This was original 
            research completed as part of the requirements for my Master of Science degree from Michigan State University. The model was 
            written in Fortran and based on previous work done by my advisor, Cheryl Murphy. </p>
