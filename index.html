          <h3>Detecting sea lions in aerial images</h3>
          <p>This project uses pytorch to perform object detection and classification. The data consist of aerial images of sea lions 
            along the coast of Alaska. In wildlife management, aerial surveys are often used to estimate the size of animal populations 
            that occupy large spatial ranges. Aerial photographic surveys can capture many animals at a time over vast habitats; but it 
            can be time-consuming and difficult for human analysts to identify and count all these animals. Computer vision methods show 
            great promise in improving the speed and accuracy of identifying and classifying animals in aerial imagery.</p>

          <h3>Predicting short-term electricity demand</h3>
          <p>This project demonstrates the use of Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) 
            models for short-term electricity demand prediction. ARMA and ARIMA are popular methods for analyzing and predicting future 
            values based on historical data. Prediction quality is evaluated using RMSE. Predicting and planning for future electricity 
            demand is an important task for companies that supply electricity.</p>

          <h3>Tracking the spread of Lyme disease</h3>
          <p>This project uses maps to visualize changes in Lyme disease occurrence over time. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection 
            caused by the spirochete bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, typically transmitted to humans through the bite of infected 
            black-legged ticks. It can lead to various symptoms, including fever, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint aches, and swollen 
            lymph nodes. If left untreated, it can progress to more severe complications affecting the heart, nervous system, and joints. 
            Knowing where the disease occurs can help people take preventative measures and seek treatment when appropriate.</p>

          <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis of World C02 Emissions</h3>
          <p>This project consists of a collection of jupyter notebooks that demonstrate common techniques used in exploratory data analysis (EDA).
             EDA is crucial in data analysis as it enables researchers and data scientists to gain a deep understanding of the dataset at hand. 
             By visually and statistically examining the data, EDA helps uncover patterns, identify outliers, 
             detect data quality issues, and reveal hidden relationships between variables. It aids in formulating hypotheses, selecting 
             appropriate modeling techniques, and making informed decisions during subsequent analysis. Python Pandas was used for data cleaning
             and manipulation while the Altair library was used for visualization.</p>

          <h3>Predicting the Extent of Harmful Algal Blooms Using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>This was a team project (developed with Charles H and Shyam V) completed during my University of Michigan Master of Applied 
            Data Science program. We used a form of unsupervised semantic segmentation to identify clusters of related pixels in 
            satellite images of lakes. The aim was to identify the presence and estimated extent of harmful algal blooms.</p>
